# XL-FFT

A formula-based Fast Fourier Transform for Excel.

Calculate real and complex Fourier transforms of one-dimensional arrays in Excel without VBA macros.


## Installation

The recommended installation method is Microsoft's [Advanced Formula Environment](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/profiles/advanced-formula-environment-a-microsoft-garage-project/) for Excel.
Create a new module (the suggested name is `FFT`, but any name will work) and paste the contents of the file `XL-FFT.xlf`, or import directly from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/altomani/0b56cb0eac5a0b083620b8471fc76271).

Alternatively, it is also possible to copy the individual definition of `LAMBDA` formulas into the Excel Name manager, after removing all comments (and the trailing semicolon).
